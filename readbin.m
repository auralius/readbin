function output = readbin(bin_file, n_channels, data_type)
% This function reads a general binary file that contains a sequence of
% numbers. This function then reshapes those numbers into a matrix of
% N x n_channels where N depends on how many number are there.
%
% This function has been tested for binary files created by LabVIEW and
% Armadillo library.
%
% bin_file: the binary file must be composed by n_channels of double or
% int32 data type.
%
% n_channels: number of channels
% output: channel-1 is in row-1
%         channel-2 is in row-2
%         channel-3 is in row-3
%         and so on ...
%
% Example = data = readbin('logged_data.bin', 45, 'double');
