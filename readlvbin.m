function output = readlvbin(bin_file, n_channels)
% This function converts LabVIEW binary file into TAB delimitted text file.
%
% bin_file: the binary file must be composed by n_channels of double 
% DOUBLE-type data.
%
% n_channels: number of channels
% output: channel-1 is in row-1
%         channel-2 is in row-2
%         channel-3 is in row-3
%         and so on ...

% Example = data = readlvbin('logged_data.bin', 45);
